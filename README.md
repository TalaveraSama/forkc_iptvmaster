# IPTVMaster

IPTVMaster is a private, self-hosted manager for live-TV playlists and EPG
data. It sits between your IPTV provider and your player: it imports the
provider's changing M3U and XMLTV feeds on a schedule, preserves your permanent
edits across those changes, and publishes clean, token-protected playlist and
guide URLs that any IPTV player can consume.

It does not proxy, relay, transcode, record, or redistribute video — published
playlists contain direct provider stream URLs, so playback traffic never passes
through IPTVMaster.

## What it does

**Lineup editing that survives provider refreshes**

- Rename provider groups, build custom categories, and reorder groups and
  channels with drag or keyboard/touch-friendly arrow buttons.
- Every group that reaches the playlist — provider, live-event, or custom —
  is published or hidden from one list. A custom category is a slice of a
  provider group, so it carries its own visibility rather than following the
  group it was carved from.
- Per-channel renames, logos, visibility, and ordering, with bulk selection
  tools for large playlists.
- Provider changes are reconciled conservatively: safe matches follow
  automatically, uncertain ones go to a review queue with an audit trail, and
  manual matches are locked until you release them.
- Providers rotate channel identifiers, so entries regularly stop matching. A
  channel absent from five consecutive refreshes is retired along with its
  edits (`CHANNEL_RETENTION_REFRESHES`); a refresh that returns unchanged data
  does not count. Groups are never retired automatically.
- Groups you do not want at all can be removed outright. Their channels are
  deleted and refreshes will not import them again, but the group is remembered
  and can be restored at any time.

**Films and series, without the bulk**

- A provider's catalogue dwarfs its live lineup — hundreds of thousands of
  titles against tens of thousands of channels is normal. Every refresh records
  which categories exist and how large they are, but stores nothing until you
  ask for a category by name.
- Movies and series are listed in their own sections and switched on or off
  like live groups. Switching one on keeps its titles from the next refresh;
  switching it off removes them at once.
- An output can carry any combination of content. Combined outputs also expose
  dedicated Live TV, Movies, and Series M3U links under the same revocable
  token for players that cannot reliably split a large mixed playlist.
- Xtream-compatible login details are generated alongside the URLs. This is
  the recommended connection for large catalogues: series are published as a
  compact show list, and a player fetches the episodes for one show only when
  needed instead of indexing every episode in a 100,000+ row M3U.

**Daily live-event groups**

- Mark transient sports/event groups as events (individually or in bulk).
  Event entries are localized from the provider timezone to yours, sorted by
  start time, and placeholder entries ("please reload your playlist") are
  hidden by pattern.
- Publish or hide whole event groups with one click.

**A shared EPG pool**

- Provider guides and any number of custom XMLTV guides are imported into one
  pool that every provider's channels can map against.
- Exact-ID and unique-name matches are automatic, with the provider's own
  guide always taking priority; ambiguous channels show their real candidates
  for one-click resolution, and a type-ahead picker searches the whole pool.
- Channels that can never have guide data (decorative separators, event
  streams) can be excluded from coverage counting — separators are detected
  and offered as a one-click bulk exclusion.

**Operations**

- A status board shows per-provider channel counts, EPG coverage, last
  refresh results, and anything that needs your attention.
- Non-overlapping scheduled refreshes with bounded retries; rejected or failed
  feeds leave the last-known-good data active. How often playlists and guides
  are checked is editable from the overview page, and each can be paused.
- Retained playlist snapshots with two-step restore and a full activity log.
- Verified PostgreSQL backups with a daily systemd timer and rehearsable
  transactional restore.

**Security posture**

- Single local administrator account (scrypt, database-backed revocable
  sessions, CSRF protection, login throttling).
- Provider and guide URLs are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before storage and
  never displayed again.
- Output URLs are long random tokens, individually revocable; only their
  hashes are stored for verification.
- Designed for trusted LAN use over a stable local address: no DNS entry,
  domain, or certificate required. Keep it off the public internet — see
  [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md). If your network is shared more widely, an
  optional overlay adds HTTPS; see [docs/HTTPS.md](./docs/HTTPS.md).

## Requirements

- Docker with the Compose plugin or rootless Podman with a Compose provider
  (deployment), or Node.js 22+ and npm 10+ (development)
- PostgreSQL 17 (provided by the compose stack)

## Quick start

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# Put these generated values into .env; keep both private.
openssl rand -hex 32       # POSTGRES_PASSWORD
openssl rand -base64 32    # IPTVMASTER_MASTER_KEY
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

The public, version-pinned image is downloaded from GHCR. The image contains
the database migrations and applies them before port 8080 opens, so there is
no separate migration container or host-mounted migration directory. Rootless
Podman users can replace `docker compose` with `podman compose`.

Open `http://localhost:8080`, create the administrator account, add your
provider's M3U (and optional XMLTV) URL, import, and shape the lineup. Then
create an output. For Live TV, use the generated `/m/<token>` playlist and
`/e/<token>` guide addresses. For Movies and Series, prefer the Xtream login
shown on the output card: the server is the IPTVMaster address, the username is
`iptvmaster`, and the password is that output's revocable access token.

Losing `IPTVMASTER_MASTER_KEY` makes stored provider credentials
unrecoverable; back it up separately and never commit it.

An app-only custom stack still needs PostgreSQL. Set `DATABASE_URL` to that
database and `IPTVMASTER_MASTER_KEY` in the app container. Do not mount
`/app/data`; IPTVMaster does not use a local database file.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run dev      # core watcher, API on :8080, Vite UI on :5173
npm run check    # format, lint, versions, typecheck, tests, build
```
